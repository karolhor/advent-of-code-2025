# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**, implemented in **Python**.  
Each day has its own directory with the puzzle input and solution files.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/karolhor/advent-of-code-2025.git
```

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies (if a requirements file appears later):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a solution:

```
python day01/part1.py input.txt
```

## Daily Workflow

For each puzzle day:

1. Create a folder: `dayNN/`
2. Add puzzle example `example.txt`
3. Add your personal `input.txt`
4. Write Python solutions (`part1.py`, `part2.py`, `solution.py`)
5. Commit & push

---

## Notes

- Do **not** commit puzzle descriptions (AoC policy).
- Inputs are personal and may differ between users.
- Solutions aim to be clean, readable, and efficient.
